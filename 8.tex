\begin{align*}
    \delta & = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\mu_0 \sigma \omega}}\\
    & = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\mu_0 \sigma 2 \pi f}}\\
    & = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\mu_0 \sigma \pi f}}\\
    & = \SI{7.5e-6}{\metre}

Plane wave penetration through a conductor falls off exponentially characterised by the skin depth. Given that $ \SI{0.1}{\milli\metre} $ is several skin depths the amplitude of the wave will be negligible when it emerges. So, $ \SI{0.1}{\milli\metre} $ of Gold is an effective shield for radio signals with this frequency.
